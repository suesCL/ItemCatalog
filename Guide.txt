Item Catalog: Getting Started

Project Description:
In this project, you will be developing a web application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories 
integrate third party user registration and authentication
Authenticated users should have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items.

======================
the homepage displays all current categories with the latest added items.
        
Selecting a specific category shows you all the items available for that category.

Selecting a specific item shows you specific information about that item.

After logging in, a user has the ability to add, update, or delete item information. Users should be able to modify only those items that they themselves have created.


Note that the link is ‘http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard’. 
This is to ensure ease of readability.


The application should provide a JSON endpoint at the very least.
==========================
Getting Started

There are four parts that you will need to complete:
@the HTML (structure of the pages)
@the CSS (the style of the pages)
@the Flask Application (to put it online)
@it must include authentication/authorization to allow users to login before making changes
@the database (to store and organize the information)
As long as you hit these four parts, it doesn’t matter where you begin, whether you begin with the HTML/CSS or Flask and the database. If you’re looking for a little bit more guidance
